> These domains are owned by a teenager by the name of Seth Stephens (relative) and his friends. They&#039;ve been harassing me with my personal information for the past week, even sending police to my house saying I&#039;m held hostage. He&#039;s also threatened my parents by getting their phone number and calling in a threatening matter as if I didn&#039;t come to the phone I&#039;d be murdered. He&#039;s also managed to find a sexually explicit image of mine I posted when I was 15, not knowing any better. So basically he has illegal material hosted on his domains aswell :)
